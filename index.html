      <p class="skills-text">One of my hobbies is hiking. My family and I have gone to many states around the country on hiking trips. Hiking is great because it allows me to take
        a breath and relax. It also is great because it shows me that precision is needed in everything. On some of the trips my family and I go on, we'll have to
        climb rocks and little hills. When you are manuevering around these rocks and are next to a cliff, you need precision. With my experience in this hobby, I can
        bring precision to the workplace.</p>

      <p class="skills-text">Coding is great. Especially with our world, knowing how to code at least a little bit is essential for work. Coding not only gives you knowledge about coding,
        but is give you insight on how to solve problems. Fun fact, this website you're looking at I entirely coded myself. From experience, coding can be quite troublesome.
        Errors can pop up that anger you and make you want to quit. That actually helps me in the workplace because I can break down problems that arise, find the
        root of the problem, and how I should go about fixing it.</p>
